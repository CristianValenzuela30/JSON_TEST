I argue that much of the popular support for homeopathy comes from its categorization as a “naturist treatment”, an argumentative time-work that mobilizes normative dimensions of time, and its inclusion in a health trajectory that hybridizes the boundaries between biomedicine and homeopathy. I develop the concept of a pragmatic regime of health to account for the fact that many supporters of homeopathy are less interested in the ideological aspects and implications of homeopathic knowledge but rather see it as a medical therapy that supplements biomedicine’s limits and counteracts its iatrogenic effects.

               "description":"Purpose:\nThis paper aims to explore Internet users' lived experiences with video ads, both skippable and nonskippable, while watching content on YouTube.\n\nDesign/methodology/approach:\nIn-depth interviews were conducted with 22 participants.\n\nFindings:\nThe participants unanimously expressed dissatisfaction with YouTube ads. The dissatisfaction was directed to the platform but did not spill over to the advertised brand/product. Ethical concerns related to privacy also emerged. Specifically, with respect to nonskippable ads, the participants expressed dislike for forced viewing and explained how they would engage in extraneous activities during the ads. Nonetheless, they appreciated the flexibility offered by skippable ads. They also elaborated on how, why and when they would skip/not skip skippable ads.\n\nOriginality/value:\nThe findings are discussed in light of the literature on not only online advertising but also platform switching versus continuance intention, spillover effect, privacy–personalization paradox and visual attention.",

               "description":"On Airbnb, profile photos play a crucial role in decision-making. This paper examines how hosts’ profile photos—specifically, gender, facial expression and the presence of sunglasses—affect guests’ intentions to trust and book. An experiment was conducted to seek both close- and open-ended responses (N = 524), the former analyzed statistically and the latter thematically. According to the quantitative results, female hosts were preferred to males. Positive facial expressions outperformed neutral ones. A significant interaction effect emerged such that the positive effect of a positive facial expression was stronger when sunglasses were present (vs. absent). Moreover, a mediated moderation was identified: The interaction between facial expression and the use of sunglasses on intention to book was mediated by intention to trust. Themes from the qualitative analysis complement and extend the quantitative results. Overall, the paper adds to the literature on online profile photos in the context of peer-to-peer tourism and hospitality platforms.",

               "description":"Borderline Personality Disorder is a mental disorder that impacts a person’s way of thinking and feeling about himself or others. This creates self-doubt, self-image problems, difficulty in managing emotions and behavior, as well as leads to unstable relationships. But this disorder can be cured with proper treatment if diagnosed early. The aim of this research is to explore potential features in the detection of Borderline Personality Disorder using machine learning methods. Furthermore, it identifies the potential features(here emotions) which are responsible in the detection of Borderline Personality Disorder. Data were collected in two ways one from self declared user in social media(i.e. who declared themselves as Borderline Personality Disorder patients) and second by inviting people for a Borderline Personality Disorder screening test Permission has been taken to fetch their social media data for research. This research achieved an accuracy of 81.03% using Random Forest classification algorithm. Emotional features were extracted from each data point in the dataset to identify the potential features for Borderline Personality Disorder classification. Features such as nervousness, shame, and pain have been derived that can in turn contribute to a similar accuracy to about 81.25%. This attempt is to explain the heuristic explanation, how differently an individual with Borderline Personality Disorder reacts from other individuals. This research paves the way for identifying Borderline Personality Disorder among individuals.",

In particular, I taught him Java and Data Structure, in both of which he was among the top 5% students. He was not only able to complete all his assigned tasks timely but also actively participate in class discussions. He performed exceedingly well within the scope of the tasks that he was required to do.\n\nMore remarkably, Lalit is motivated, and good in planning, setting milestones, and meeting deadlines. I never had to chase him to get things done. This shows that he is responsible, and can work without being under close supervision. Lalit impressed me with his positive energy that comes from his attitude towards learning both in and out of the classroom. I am confident that he will continue to display the same commitment and diligence in everything he does.   \n\nMoreover, his communication skills are decent, and has good interpersonal skills. I see in him the potential to develop into an efficient member in workforce he would join. \n\nI am confident that his strong intellect, affability, coupled with his ability to work well both independently and collaboratively would make him an invaluable asset within your ranks. In fact, he may eventually prove to be one of the best among all your new hires."

               "text":"To Whom It May Concern:\n\nI am writing this letter in order to act as a referee for Cristina Iacobone. \n\nI have known Miss Iacobone since October 2018 when she took the lead in offering ‘Academic Writing Skills’ for the postgraduate taught students in the Department of Social Policy and Social Work, at the University of York. In my role as Director of Postgraduate Taught programmes in Social Policy I worked closely with Miss Iacobone in developing the curriculum and setting key learning objectives for the ‘Academic Writing Skills’ sessions for both 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years. The sessions run through the academic year and are an integral part of the academic support training we offer at the Department of Social Policy and Social Work. \n\nMiss Iacobone’s role involved the delivery of a wide set of academic writing skills such as report writing, interpretation of data, structuring and building an argument, critical thinking and synthesising reading materials. Miss Iacobone also facilitated the Dissertation writing skills for postgraduate taught students for academic year 2018-19. Miss Iacobone received excellent feedback from students in both academic years and I regard that her contributions were vital to the learning development of our postgraduate taught students. Miss Iacobone was responsive and quick to adapt both to individual and cohort learning. I was really impressed by her ability to contextualise both learning materials and teaching our diverse and international student body and in supporting our students in transitioning from their own established academic writing cultural practices to the standards expected in a British higher education environment. \n\nMiss Iacobone devoted a lot of effort and reflective thinking on planning and developing learning materials using a range of strategies to facilitate independent learning and support students towards the realisation of their own individual learning styles and strengths. The applicant developed an assessment for students to map their learning needs and formulated accordingly materials that would help students evaluate their own learning development.\n\nIn addition to her professional work, Miss Iacobone has been a really positive, friendly and kind person to work with and she maintains strong commitment to inclusive and reflective learning approaches. Having got to know her during the last two academic years both personally and professionally, I am able to recommend her unreservedly for the post you are recruiting. \n\nIf you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. \n\nYours sincerely,\nAntonios Roumpakis\nSenior Lecturer in Comparative Social Policy, \nChair of Board of Studies\nUniversity of York, Heslington, York, UK."

Her research focuses on the emergence and development of mechanisms of knowledge creation and diffusion that connect the micro level of firm dynamics with the meso level of industry evolution. She has conducted extensive qualitative and archival research within organisations of small to large sizes, spanning different empirical domains including, among others, design as a driver for innovation, inter-organisational collaborations as vehicles to knowledge creation, and the strategic opportunities and challenges attached to the advent of digital technologies. \n\nCurrently, Professor D'Ippolito is working on a wide array of projects that relate to, among others, the role of design in shaping firms' strategy-making, the way organisations embrace the potential of digital technologies with a focus on creative industries, and the nature and dynamics of the processes that characterise business model innovation.\n\nHer research appeared in various outlets, including Research Policy, Long Range Planning, Technovation, Industry and Innovation, Creativity and Innovation Management, and Entrepreneurship and Regional Development. Prof D'Ippolito currently sits on the Editorial Advisory Boards of Research Policy and Industry and Innovation and, as of January 2023, she serves as Associate Editor of the Journal of Management Studies.",

I am thrilled to be working on the FixOurFood programme which will focus on transforming the Yorkshire food system. I'm still loving my work with N8 AgriFood at a time when food systems policy is more important than ever. I also love my work as a maths and chemistry tutor, working with young people to build their knowledge and confidence. And as if that is not enough, I run, with my husband Dave Gledhill, 1790 Creative (creative agency) and 1790 Cards (greetings cards publishing)!  For more info, check out FixOurFood (fixourfood.org) N8 AgriFood Policy Hub (policyhub.n8agrifood.ac.uk) and 1790 Cards (1790cards.co.uk).",

I also teach on the Masters in Global Marketing programme on which Chandrayee Gupta was a full-time student in 2014-2015.\r\nIn fact, Chandrayee was one of our top students in her cohort (52 students) with the highest average mark of any student. She was a delight to teach and her work is of publishable quality. Chandrayee is polite, diligent, determined and enormously talented. She also never missed any seminars or lectures. Due to her qualities I did try to persuade her to apply for one of our PhD scholarships but her preference is a business career.\r\nChandrayee also contributed to the life of University by being a leader in bringing different cultures together in both different action learning sets and cultural programme and she has a strong ability to work across cultures.\r\nThere is no doubt that Chandrayee Gupta would be a valuable employee for any organisation and she would be a real asset.\r\nYours Sincerely,\r\nProfessor Bob Doherty\r\nActing Dean\r\nThe York Management School\r\nUniversity of York\r\nYork\r\nYO10 5GD\r\nUK\r\n\r\n"

The research is based on ethnographical data, gathered in two longitudinal studies 2005-2008. The methods used in the study include open-ended unstructured interviews, participant observations, stories collection, and shadowings.\nFindings – It is found that the currently dominant theory of normative control explaining software engineers workplace diminishes leisure and entertainment attributes of knowledge work. Fun at workplace is discovered to be an important, if not crucial, element of everyday programmers’ job.\nOriginality/value – The study contributes to the literature by replying to the call for more research on high-tech organizational practices, and on non-job related behaviors at workplace. It reveals playful performance as a constituent for knowledge work and may contribute towards a better understanding of the role played by fun and playful behavior in creative problem-solving and inventing.\nKeywords: Software engineering, Organizational culture, Behaviour",

The communication technique Intensive Interaction, however, honours personhood. The current study aimed to explore how paid caregivers of people with dementia enact societal discourses of dementia, with and without the context of Intensive Interaction. This was to explore ways to address the loss of personhood in dementia care.",

I am currently a Lecturer in HRM and Programme leader MSc HRM at the York Management School, University of York, UK. Before moving to York, I was a Teaching Fellow at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). I teach at undergraduate and postgraduate levels across General Management, Human Resource Management, Business ethics, Organisation Studies, Organisational Psychology, Employment Relations, among others. \n\nIn my research and publications, I use multi-qualitative methods that span ethnography, narrative, phenomenological, grounded theory, and case study research approaches, including interviews, observations, focus groups, Delphi methods, vignettes (vignette-elicited interviewing), photo-elicitation, life histories. I work within a broadly interpretivist paradigm and therefore engage with research using an interpretivist, social constructivist/social constructionist lens. I also use analytical approaches such as thematic analysis and narrative analysis, content analysis, media (web) analysis, document analysis. \n\nMy research interests span general management, international management, human resource management, and organization studies. I am interested in equality, diversity, and inclusion (EDI), inequality, fairness, and social justice, and international management practices in emerging and culturally diverse and developing economies, new challenges, weakly understood meanings facing the Global North and Global South, including HRM practices in nation-states, formal and informal organizations, international companies, NGOs, and their impact on sustainable development and societal inequalities.\n\nI am currently a co-researcher in two funded research projects sponsored by the British Academy of Management (BAM) and Money & Pensions Service (UK). I am the Assistant Editor of Personnel Review (ABS 2*). Recent research output in the broader field of international management include a published report, a book chapter, and articles in revision and review in ABS 4* Journals.",

               "description":"This book provides a new perspective on innovation in consultancy firms. Focusing on how consultancy firms can innovate in the modern era, it exposes and discusses key drivers for innovation in the industry. These are broken down into 5 dimensions - or ‘Poles’ - relating to forms of capital (human capital, social capital, and three types of organizational capital) that consultancy firms can use in order to innovate, both for themselves and for their clients.\n\nReaders of this book will not only gain insight into the \"innovative consultancy\" from the perspective of each of these Poles. They will also discover how consultancy firms need to find the right way of connecting these Poles together in order to produce the desired innovation. Readers will learn about the dangers of misaligning the Poles, as well as implications of innovative consultancy for ethics, academic research in the field of consultancy, and for careers. In addition to the academic literature, the book draws from real-world examples, cases and practice insights from various parts of the world.\n\nThis book will be of great use to those interested in pursuing a career in the consultancy industry, whether they are undergraduate and postgraduate Business & Management students, students not necessarily studying in Business Schools, or others seeking a career move into consultancy. It will also be valuable to seasoned consultants and managers of consultancy firms seeking new ideas on how to develop innovative capabilities in an increasingly competitive industry.",

Chris was the Programme Director and Strategic Case Analysis module leader when I studied on Durham University’s Online MBA course. I also worked closely with him as Joint Chairs of the Student Staff Coordination Committee. As Programme Director, Chris was inventive, coming up with new ways to bring the material to life and encourage students to apply their learning. Through this, he added immense value to the Programme with initiatives such as the Case Study Competition. He is receptive to student ideas and feedback. Through the COVID-19 crisis, Chris communicated excellently with the student body. What was outstanding was the resourceful way in which Chris led his team to adapt to the logistical challenges without disrupting the learning experience. Indeed, Chris saw it as a chance to broaden the opportunities for interaction and add further value to the MBA. \nAs module leader for the SCA, Chris outlined the requirements early in the MBA programme, encouraging students to consider topics and material throughout the course. Chris’s subject matter expertise is evident in each engagement.\nChris is an expert in his field and I will definitely look to study under him in my future education. I would highly recommend Chris to add increased value and an improved learning experience to any Programme. "

What was noteworthy was his ability to successfully lead through this period with effective communications, excellent stakeholder management and an ability to view the situation strategically.

She consistently demonstrated a high level of analytical ability as well as social and communication skills in articulating her analysis and judgement on complex organizational issues. She was really well-liked within her peer group and was always willing to go the extra distance to contribute to our class goals as well as contribute to other projects and initiatives. One of these initiatives was a consultancy assignment that she did (single-handedly) with a local charity in the North East of England. She engaged with the client, researched the problem, produced a framework for delivery and then made a high quality and professional presentation to the client which I personally witnessed. This is just one example of her all round ability and I wholeheartedly recommend her."

The intention is for the animation to be used to present the research findings to alternative audiences to those that more commonly read academic articles. Ben and his team approached this task with great enthusiasm, suggesting lots of creative ways that the animation could be developed. They kept in touch with the team of academic writers throughout and were extremely responsive to feedback. The results are fantastic and I look forward to working with Ben and his team again in the future."

         "description":"In 2013 completed my PhD on strategic and operational decision-making within the London and South Western Railway between 1870 and 1939. My primary research interest at the moment is the management of late-nineteenth and early twentieth-century British railways, and my particular focus is on marketing in the industry and goods. I co-operated with Kevin Tennent, of the University of York's Management School, on a study of strategic decision-making within the London County Council Tramways after 1889.\n\nCurrently, I am working for the University of York's Centre for Lifelong Learning, where teach an online Masters in Railway Studies. This course examines all aspects British railway history, from the initial social, political and economical impact the railways had, up to their role in society and the economy up to 2010.\n\nI am passionate about furthering public understanding of academic history and since 2010 have written the TurnipRail railway history blog. I also frequently give public lectures on aspects of railway history, for example 'Dickens and the Railways,' 'Victorian Railwaywomen,' and 'The Life of George Bradshaw.' I also contribute to magazines and occasionally contribute to RAIL magazine.",

               "description":"In the 1970s, the voluntary sector acted as a key space for advocacy and support for communities that were marginalised from statutory provision. This paper explores how East London voluntary sector organisations addressed the needs of new migrant communities in this period. Drawing on data from six case study organisations, this historical study explores the dual role these organisations played in advocating for these communities and providing needed services. The findings show that in the 1970s through the 1990s advocacy and service delivery functions were closely linked rather than service delivery crowding out advocacy as has been the trend in recent decades. The findings also emphasise the importance of the creation of trusted relationships between the organisations and the communities they served.",

               "description":"The secondary school system in England has undergone a radical transformation since 2010 with the rapid expansion of independent academies run by private companies (‘academy trusts’) and funded directly by central government. This paper examines the development of academies and their predecessors, city technology colleges, and explores the extent and nature of continuity and change. It is argued that processes of layering and policy revision, together with austerity measures arising from economic recession, have resulted in a system-wide change with private, non-profit-making companies, funded by central government, rapidly replacing local authorities as the main providers of secondary school education.",

My PhD is in Political Science.",

               "description":"This article investigates business models innovation for delivering health care at the base of the pyramid (BoP). The examination of six health care organizational cases suggests that co-creation of patient needs, community engagement, continuous involvement of customers, innovative medical technology, focus on human resources for health, strategic partnerships, economies of scale, and cross-subsidization are business model innovation strategies that enable inclusive health care delivery. Based on these findings, we propose a four-dimensional framework. A process of value discovery, leading BoP patients and communities to recognize a health need and seek for an acceptable treatment, precedes the identification of a successful value proposition. Value creation and value appropriation then follow to warrant patient affordability and organizational sustainability. A “business model mechanism” for BoP health care hence emerges, where interdependencies among these dimensions are highlighted. This article sheds new light on how market-based approaches can improve equitable health care access and hence contribute to poverty alleviation."

               "description":"The implemented multiple-strategy community intervention National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) between 2005 and 2012 aimed to reduce maternal and child health (MCH) inequalities across geographical, socioeconomic and gender categories in India. The objective of this study is to quantify the extent of reduction in these inequalities pre- and post-NRHM in Haryana, North India.\nData of district-level household surveys (DLHS) held before (2002-04), during (2007-08), and after (2012-13) the implementation of NRHM has been used.\nGeographical, socioeconomic and gender inequalities in maternal and child health were assessed by estimating the absolute differences in MCH indicators between urban and rural areas, between the most advantaged and least advantaged socioeconomic groups and between male and female children. Logistic regression analyses were done to observe significant differences in these inequalities between 2005 and 2012.\nThere were significant improvements in all MCH indicators (p<0.05). The geographical and socioeconomic differences between urban and rural areas, and between rich and poor were significantly (p<0.05) reduced for pregnant women who had an institutional delivery (geographical difference declining from 22% to 7.6%; socioeconomic from 48.2% to 13%), post-natal care within 2 weeks of delivery (2.8% to 1.5%; 30.3% to 7%); and for children with full vaccination (10% to 3.5%, 48.3% to 14%) and who received oral rehydration solution (ORS) for diarrhea (11% to -2.2%; 41% to 5%). Inequalities between male and female children were significantly (p<0.05) reversed for full immunization (5.7% to -0.6%) and BCG immunization (1.9 to -0.9 points), and a significant (p<0.05) decrease was observed for oral polio vaccine (4.0% to 0%) and measles vaccine (4.2% to 0.1%).\n"

               "publisher":"International Journal of Health Planning and Management",
               "date":"Jan 1, 2016",
               "description":"This work aims to test whether different segments of healthcare provision differentially attract private capital and thus offer heterogeneous opportunities for private investors' diversification strategies.\nThomson Reuter's SDC Platinum database provided data on 2563 merger and acquisition (M&A) deals targeting healthcare providers in Western Europe between 1990 and 2010. Longitudinal trends of industrial and geographical characteristics of M&As' targets and acquirers are examined.\n\nOur analyses highlight: (i) a relative decrease of long-term care facilities as targets of M&As, replaced by an increasing prominence of general hospitals, (ii) a shrinking share of long-term care facilities as targets of financial service organizations' acquisitions, in favor of general hospitals, and (iii) an absolute and relative decrease of long-term care facilities' role as target of cross-border M&As.\nWe explain the decreasing interest of private investors towards long-term care facilities along three lines of reasoning, which take into account the saturation of the long-term care market and the liberalization of acute care provision across Western European countries, regulatory interventions aimed at reducing private ownership to ensure resident outcomes and new cultural developments in favor of small-sized facilities, which strengthen the fragmentation of the sector. These findings advance the literature investigating the effect of private ownership on health outcomes in long-term facilities. Market, policy and cultural forces have emerged over two decades to jointly regulate the presence of privately owned, large-sized long-term care providers, seemingly contributing to safeguard residents' well-being.

Nancy is a real motivator and proactively guides people towards the goal, listening to ideas and absorbing insight along the way to maximise quality and success.

I needed help with a very specific piece of work which could be seen as a fairly complex piece. \r\n \r\nSome people see the whole picture, Tim goes beyond that, he is the creator of the clearest, simplest picture but at the same time has the cleverest ability to convey every little detail.\r\n\r\nThe challenge for Tim for this particular piece of work, was to try and make sense of the complexity and transform the information into something much more tangible and easy to digest, & something that could be presented in a number of different ways (for example, embedded within a Prezi to enlarged and printed on A1/A3).\r\n\r\nFrom the word go, it became clear that Tim is a complete professional who consistently puts the Client at the heart of everything he does.  \r\nTim is a complete natural when it comes to his relationship building and stakeholder management approach.  Tim works hard to get to the real 'nitty gritty' of what ‘you’ as the Client wants to achieve. \r\nTim’s questioning style is open and honest and he remains focused on the goal at all times.  Tim will always think of options for you, he never comes to you with a question in mind that isn't backed up by a number of options for you to consider.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, Tim's time management approach and desire to keep 'you' the 'Client' informed of progress made is second to none.  There was never a time where I thought I needed an update from him as he continued to keep me informed at all stages.   It's clear to see that Tim is naturally creative and gifted in his chosen field.  I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent working with Tim.  He had quite a tricky job to digest, analyse and simplify the vast amount of information I sent through to him.  Yet he did this with enthusiasm and passion.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't hesitate in recommending Tim and I look forward to working with him again in the future & also hearing more about his continued success."

The study identifies the ways in which universities might better support female working-class students in the development of aspiration. \nThe capabilities approach provides a framework for the study which foregrounds issues of agency and social justice in the process of aspiration development. The thesis brings together Bourdieusian theory and theories of reflexivity to provide new insights to individual agency in aspiration development. My analysis of participant stories indicates that class-based differences in capital influence the extent of agency in the development of aspirations, and that the accumulation of capital is important to the reflexive accommodation of change to personal biography and enhancement of individual agency."

This study considers the perspective of UK graduates training for the CIMA professional accountancy qualification and examines their perceptions of the extent to which opportunities for generic skills development are exploited in accounting degrees. The results are compared with opportunities for generic skills development in degrees from other discipline areas, formal work-based training and the training undertaken when studying for professional examinations. The results of the questionnaire-based survey suggest that there is scope for improvement in the extent to which universities exploit opportunities for the development of generic skills. However, across most skill areas trainees’ perceptions of opportunities for the development of generic skills in UK accounting degrees are comparable to those offered in other discipline areas and compare favourably to those offered in both professional training and formal work-based training. The results indicate that the development of oral communication skills, the ability to take a comprehensive and global vision of an organisation, resilience and ethical awareness could be improved.",

               "description":"The paper examines the principal determinants of an organization's susceptibility to theft and fraud in the context of a rational economic framework in which the level of protection is determined by the minimization of cost. The empirical study shows that, adjusting for differences in organizational type and industrial sector, both organizational susceptibility and the size of a typical theft or fraud increase with organizational size. Access to resources and the manner in which the theft or fraud is perpetrated are also important determinants of the money lost. However, they are unaffected by management controls or the nature of their violation. "

            "description":"Since its inception in 1992, the Journal of Financial Regulation and Compliance has provided an authoritative and scholarly platform for international research in financial regulation and compliance. The journal is at the intersection between academic research and the practice of financial regulation, with distinguished past authors including senior regulators, central bankers and even a prime minister.\n \nFinancial crises, predatory practices, internationalisation and integration, the increased use of technology and financial innovation are just some of the changes and issues that contemporary financial regulators are grappling with. These challenges and changes hold profound implications for regulation and compliances, ranging from macro-prudential to consumer protection policies. The journal seeks to illuminate these issues, is pluralistic in approach and invites scholarly papers using any appropriate methodology.\n\nAccordingly, the journal welcomes submissions from finance, law, economics and interdisciplinary perspectives. A broad spectrum of research styles, sources of information and topics (e.g. banking laws and regulations, stock market and cross border regulation, risk assessment and management, training and competence, competition law, case law, compliance and regulatory updates and guidelines) are appropriate. All submissions are double-blind refereed and judged on academic rigour, originality, quality of exposition and relevance to policy and practice."

               "text":"Aaron was a student on my module Strategic Planning 2021 to 22. The module is a tough 20 credit master module, with heavy academic content but also a big teamwork component with challenging task working with diverse individuals that the students are placed with, they do not set up their own groups. \n\nAarons team won the game, a strategic simulation run over several weeks, against 5 other teams. Aaron was a key component of that victory, with his group awarding him high marks in the peer marking section. Showing his ability to lead and organise the diverse group to make diverse and brave decision to push themselves forward was very much appreciated by them. As much as it was by myself as his teacher. \n\nIt is clear to me that without Aarons ability to lead and communicate with a group of 6 people from 4 different countries they would not have achieved so much so quickly. I was particularly impressed by his ability to bridge the practical and the academic. He was intelligent enough to quickly grasp the concepts, frameworks and theories of strategy, and then apply them to the practice of the game well. He also had the emotional intelligence to be able to explain the results to others, and to lead them to success. All of this done in the second language of the entire group, none were first language English speakers but the game was played in English.\n\nOn the whole if you want a problem solver who can apply frameworks to analyse and evaluate a situation, who can then develop solutions and communicate them quickly and simply to others, and then to lead the successful implementation of those solutions I doubt you will go far wrong with Aaron."

Ross undertook this at the most difficult time as it was during covid lockdown and so he was unable to meet his colleagues in person at the beginning, and throughout the placement opportunities to be in the office were much reduced.\n\nDespite this he settled in well and contributed to the office work in a number of ways, both in general company work such as coordinating programme-wide governance meetings, publishing of key deliverables for the client, as well as chairing various team meetings and in some special ways such as helping to set up recruitment and induction for the following years industrial placements.\n\nOne of his greatest strengths is his ability to work on a variety of projects at once, his willingness to volunteer and to take responsibility and his strong communication and empathetic skills. His only real weakness is perhaps a tendency to over volunteer on occasion when his enthusiasm gets the better of him. In general, I find his enthusiasm infectious and recommend him most highly."

               "text":"Rachel Li was a student of mine on the module Strategic Planning, part of the MPA at the University of York from January to April 2018. The module is group work, based around a simulation game where teams compete in a geo-political simulation. Rachel was a leading light of her group and took an active role in the high pressure and quite stressful ongoing group activities. \n\nWhen her turn to present came she was confident and forthright and developed several interesting and innovative strategic ideas that helped her group progress in the game and showed a deep understanding of the true nature of strategy, not just a surface theoretical understanding. She also played a major and confident role in her groups final video presentation and I feel she exhibited leadership and communication skills in abundance.\n\nRachel is a strong personality, and bought a toughness to her group, and she has capability to convince and persuade others to her point of view while being open to the suggestions of others, a sign of true leadership. In the game her groups success, while not down to her alone, was greatly enhanced by her contribution. \n\nRachel can assimilate information rapidly, understands the concept of bounded rationality and can therefore make decisions that are good for the moment but are adaptable in the face of change. She is resilient when things go wrong, and difficulties arise as is the case deliberately in the game when we involve scenarios to test the students strengths in both these crucial areas. \n\nI cannot recommend Rachel highly enough to any organisation or team that wants someone who combines quick thinking with leadership and sophisticated information processing and quick and adaptable decision making."

               "text":"It goes without saying Anish is bright and intelligent, after all he secured a highly competitive place at a top management school but where Anish excels over others in the same situation is that he recognizes that his university career is about more than a degree, it is about taking opportunities and also, to a certain extent, giving back while still maintaining the high academic standards that got him to York in the first place. In that he has undoubtedly been successful. \n\nTo this end Anish has worked to be part of the community, he plays for the Heslington East rugby team and he has volunteered at the start of the second year as a contact and support for freshers, a kind of big brother role to help the new students settle in. Away from the university he volunteered in a local school where he assisted year 10 pupils acting as a role model. \n\nHe has also taken more direct career development opportunities, he came to me early about looking for opportunities and has already, only at the start of his second year, spent two weeks at Michigan State University studying Leadership and Entrepreneurship, gained a place with the highly competitive York Community Consulting team assisting local small businesses and attended York Consulting Conference 2017. In addition to these major initiatives he has been a regular on the optional personal development events we run here in the York Management School. Any of these are the sign of a good student, all of them together are very impressive.\n\nHe is naturally gifted in communication and thoughtfulness, good characteristics for any employee, but in addition he is building and developing his communication and empathy through the above combination. I commend him most strongly to any employer."

I taught her on the International Political Economy and Business module where she showed high motivation and dedication to hard work. She was always well prepared for the workshops and did extensive reading in addition to the core requirements and was not shy in coming forward in discussion.\r\n\r\nThe course Mandy was on was extremely diverse, and unlike others who shy away from this she saw it as an opportunity to get involved in an open- minded way, showing strong evidence of cultural awareness and understanding and successful acting as a pivot point for overcoming cultural difficulties and misunderstandings in the groups. With her help her groups excelled, my module was one of many on which she achieved a distinction.\r\n\r\nAs a second language English speaker she was so good it was not at all noticeably so in either her speech or her written work. She was gregarious and popular on the course, having excellent interpersonal skills and managed to show excellent personal management skills in that she involved herself in Department and College activities which though good for her as relaxation also further enable her to mix social with a very diverse group.\r\n\r\nIn general I cannot recommend Mandy highly enough, a great student and a really pleasant young lady.\r\n"

         "description":"I am a mid-career academic with extensive post qualification experience working at the University of York and the Open University.  My research interests focus on the fields of management and business history, particularly around concerns relating to structures, governance, and institutions.  My pedagogical interests lay in the application of historical and archival research to management studies.  I have published a number of peer-reviewed journal contributions and book chapters, which you can see more details of here - https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uZJrm8IAAAAJ&hl=en\n \nI have particular industry research expertise and policy interests in the fields of transport, sport, international business, and music, as well as a broad interest in industrial competitiveness and organizational forms in the industry around the world, particularly with relation to the British, North American, European and Australasian economies.\n\nI have also demonstrated academic leadership skills, serving in programme leadership roles since 2014, but since the Covid-19 pandemic playing more of a role in School and University level leadership.  Since 2021 I have served as Director of Teaching and Learning in my school with responsibility for strategy affecting nearly 2,500 students. I am currently implementing the university's semesterisation strategy as well as contributing to the school's drive for AACSB accreditation.\n\nI have been teaching in universities since 2006 when I started teaching at LSE as a GTA.  Since then I have developed and taught modules at both UG and PGT levels on strategic management and, international business and management. Since 2018 have developed a pioneering management and business history module for third-year undergraduates.  I have extensive experience of teaching for distance learning to post-experience students as well as teaching pre-experience students on campus and have contributed teaching to MBA students at The Open University as well as contributing to York's distance learning MA in Railway Studies since 2014.",

Then I compare and contrast five particular companies, \nexamining their management structures and control mechanisms with a \nparticular interest in how far free-standing companies internalised \ntransactions.  By doing this I have examined how competitive \nadvantage was developed by companies operating across borders in the \nlate nineteenth century, and examine their contribution to home and \nhost country economic development.  I focus on particular in \ncompanies investing in Australia, New Zealand and the USA and \nconclude that those investing in Australia and New Zealand found it \neasier to develop suitable management structures to operate across \nborders."

Unlike previous literature, which has tended to focus activities on the field, this book brings an institutional level approach to organizing the 1966 FIFA World Cup and examines the management process in the buildup and execution of the event.\n\nThis intriguing new volume looks at the first significant UK government intervention in football and how this created a significant legacy as the government started to take a real interest in leisure facilities and stadium safety as policy areas after this competition. Foundations of Managing Sporting Events will be of considerable interest to research academics working on aspects of post war British, Imperial, and World history including sport, social, business, economic, and political history.",

Prior to that I was senior lecturer at the University of Sheffield and I’ve held visiting Professorships at the University of Toronto and Carleton University, Canada. I hold a BA (Hons) in Social Policy, MSc in Research Methods and PhD in Social Policy. I have published widely on business and public policy, corporate power, corporate welfare and economic crisis and welfare states.\n\nMy research interests centre on three key areas: 1) the relative power and influence of business and labour on governments, especially with regard to social and public policy; 2) the economic crisis and welfare states; 3) corporate welfare (state assistance to corporations) and its relationship to social welfare within various welfare systems. My current work includes a book on British Corporate Welfare and two further books on the impact of austerity politics on welfare states (with Zoe Irving).",

               "description":"One of the biggest myths of the contemporary political age is that private businesses would be stronger, more competitive, and more profitable, without the state. In reality, private businesses depend extensively on public services and state benefits – in other words, on corporate welfare. Corporate welfare describes public policies that directly or indirectly meet the specific needs and/or preferences of private businesses. Such provision assists corporations through their life-course. It makes possible the birth of corporations and helps to meet their evolving needs from ‘youth’ to maturity. It provides advice and protection and, more generally, socialises the costs and risks associated with private investment and profit-making. It keeps some companies on life-support and assists some companies in their death (Farnsworth, 2013). Despite the tendency to assume that citizens are the primary beneficiaries of public policies and the welfare state, there are very few examples of public policies that do not bring benefits to private businesses. The opposite is also true, of course; many forms of corporate welfare also bring benefits to citizens.....",

         "description":"I am a HE lecturer with over 10 years of experience in the UK specializing in critical management, human resource management, organisational behaviour and business ethics. Doesn't sound very specialist, does it? But then, how we work is constantly affected by everything from psychology to politics. I am fascinated by group dynamics, and how what we do together produces who we are as individuals. In today's society much of what we do together happens in the workplace, so that's where I have concentrated my attention. \n\nLearning doesn't need to be chalk and talk. I develop innovative and play-based learning interventions, with an ambition to improve learning outcomes and accessibility whether students are in formal education or just participating in day training.\n\nI lecture and provide training and management education in a range of areas in human resource management and organisational behaviour; including topics such as diversity, organisational culture, ethics, sustainability and wellbeing. As a scholar my research specialisms are dedicated to understanding the cultural development of values and the promotion of dignity at work in the performance of everyday life.\n\nI am happy to support a range of youth development programmes and activities supporting access to HE, as well as mentoring research applicants.",

               "description":"This article explores whether social enterprises are capable of fulfilling the public policy rhetoric surrounding them, to become sustainable providers of public services. It does this by examining their marketing activity within North-East England and focuses on social enterprises delivering adult social care public services. It finds that social enterprises are employing a product-dominant approach to marketing rather than a service-oriented, relationship marketing, approach. This undermines their ability to build the enduring relationships with all their key stakeholders that are the key to effective service management and fatally weakens their potential as sustainable public service providers. The article subsequently uses service theory to build an alternative model of marketing and business practice predicated precisely upon the need to build such relationships.",

               "description":"It is commonly assumed that social enterprises (SEs) are able to meet social outcomes and also be financially viable; however, little research supports this claim. Using hybrid organizing as a lens to analyse case study interview data from ten SEs delivering adult day-care services, we identify three factors which affect an SE’s ability to simultaneously achieve social outcomes and financial sustainability and thus create value-spillovers for society. These are diverse income streams to strengthen financial viability and reduce reliance on service-level agreements and grants; delivering social quality (quality of social impact) as well as service quality, and a hybrid workforce.\n\nThis paper was awarded the Kooiman Prize for the best paper published in Public Management Review in 2019",

I completed my term as Dean in May 2022. \n\nPreviously I was Professor of Finance and Academic Leader for \"Secure and Resilient Societies\" at Loughborough University.  I have also held full-time academic appointments at the Universities of Bradford, Exeter and Warwick and visiting academic positions at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management (Northwestern University), the University of California, Irvine, and the University of Technology, Sydney. \n\nBefore becoming an academic, I worked as an equity research analyst specialising in the brewing and distilling industries for stockbrokers Savory Milln and James Capel in London. I have also worked for United Distillers in Scotland.\n\nMy research concentrates on very long-term finance problems. This work is mainly focused on far-horizon costs of capital and asset selection problems for long-term investors.  This has particular relevance for cost-benefit analyses and regulation of climate change mitigation projects and infrastructure investment.\n\nMy work has been published in interdisciplinary science (Nature Climate Change, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A, etc) and economics (American Economic Review, the Economic Journal, etc) journals as well as those in accounting & finance.  I have advised a number of international policy makers (HM Treasury, ONS, OECD, International Seabed Authority, etc) particularly on the appropriate choice of intergenerational social discount rates.",

               "description":"This study evaluates the impact of profit-sharing investment accounts (PSIAs) on shareholders’ wealth. Using probabilistic tools, we derive an explicit formula for PSIA value. We apply this formula to calculate account values for a sample of 52 banks in 13 countries and determine an empirical rank order of value-drivers. We also assess the impact of returns’ smoothing schemes on shareholders’ wealth, namely the use of reserves and/or subsidies to adjust cash returns to investment account holders. We find that the value of PSIAs varies widely amongst banks, and that originating high-quality assets dominates returns’ smoothing in the value creation process. We also find that if subsidies are used without reserves to smooth returns, then shareholders’ wealth is destroyed in the long term for 77% of banks in our sample. This finding supports the practice of prioritising reserves over subsidies to smooth returns.",

               "description":"The denominator of the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for Islamic banks includes an adjustment factor, alpha, arising from the subsidisation of investment account holders’ returns using bank equity. The methodology established by the risk management standard-setting body for Islamic banks, the IFSB, estimates an alpha for each country using panel-data and normally distributed asset returns for its credit institutions. Consequently, the IFSB methodology precludes bank-specific alphas linked to the actual risk profile of underlying assets. There is also no discernible mapping between alpha and a bank’s own propensity to subsidise cash returns. This paper instead develops a new theoretical model for bank-specific alpha that is estimated for 43 Islamic banks in 11 countries. Our alpha values broadly correspond with those of the IFSB. However, a form of regulatory arbitrage is shown to exist which favors banks with relatively high alphas. This finding also has policy implications for bank efficiency and systemic risk.",

He always made valuable contributions to in-class discussions and demonstrated a real ability to work with others. Moreover, he also demonstrated a real passion for issues around sustainability and corporate social responsibility.\n\nOverall, therefore, I thoroughly endorse Baxter. He is an enthusiastic and highly capable young man and I have no doubt that he will be a success in whatever path he takes in the future."

To do so, the thesis draws on Actor-Network Theory and more recent ideas concerning sociomateriality in order to explore the relationality between actors/actants in the context of consultancy practice. The general contribution of the thesis is to the critical social science literature concerned with the way in which consultancy relationships and boundaries are accomplished. The thesis demonstrates that the organisation of technology and the practice of spacing are not simply social practices, but on-going sociomaterial accomplishments and by implication reveals that it is materiality (intermediation) which is constitutive of consultancy relationships and boundaries."

The study appreciated the social relationships and interactions between hospice staff and with patients, as well as the sensory forms of interactions carried out by hospice workers - such as physical touch. The research sought to understand and engage with how hospice workers experience, engage with as well as understand suffering in their day-to-day work."

With a shared background in tourism, we worked well together from our first meeting.\nFrom 2015, I've worked with Nicola on our very special Heart of Steel project, which the British Heart Foundation has managed since 2018.  Throughout the past 5 years, Nicola has impressed me, in equal measure, with her determination, tenacity, integrity and diplomacy.  All these qualities and the fact that she juggles multiple interests, make me believe she is an excellent project manager. \nNicola has also supported me in my part time role as a Parent Ambassador at Sheffield Hallam University, where she is Head of Doctoral Training.  In my experience, she has always had a generosity of spirit and is an excellent mentor and team player.\nLastly I love Nicola's intellect and breadth of knowledge, her ability to join dots and see big opportunities.  So it is a genuine pleasure to continue to be in contact, even though the Heart of Steel now involves a full project team at the BHF, and my involvement is more that of patron.  \n"

               "description":"Sustainable manufacturing practices demonstrated by companies are a key ingredient to increasing business performance and competitiveness. Whilst reported practices are good examples of what has been achieved, they are company specific and difficult for others to reproduce since they provide few, if any, details on how improvements were achieved. Sustainable manufacturing strategies offer insight to the overall approach taken by companies but they lack practical support for implementation. This paper examines the gap between strategic direction and practices to extract the mechanisms behind the practices and formulate sustainable manufacturing tactics (the how question). The research is based on extensive collection and analysis of available case studies in published literature. The tactics can in turn support manufacturers in their journey towards sustainability by providing generic solutions on how to adapt their systems.",

My interaction with Richard through these 12 years has been in my role as an academic, Module Leader, Programme Leader and Chair of the Quality Committee. Over the years we have also been together on teams in successful AACSB and EQUIS and AMBA accreditation visits. I consider Richard as a close colleague and good friend. \r\n\r\nAs Module Leader I recall Richard being a very effective communicator with students. As Programme Leader I have worked closely with Richard on program approvals, specifications and QAA processes, including rather complex projects involving overseas collaborative programmes as well as on-campus provision. I always found Richard to be highly professional in handling the processual minutiae of these complex projects and found I could totally rely on him to point out the fine details which I had missed. This relationship continued through my time as Chair of the Quality Committee. I also recall his centrality in ensuring the fine details of accreditation projects were spotted − I have to say, often spotting things that more senior colleagues had overlooked!!\r\n\r\nIn my view Richard’s greatest strength is his ability to maintain internal relationships with colleagues, both administrative and academic, and I have always noted he is one of the few members of staff left who will walk down a corridor and knock on someone’s door and speak to them in person, rather than relying entirely on email − as so many now do. .This I found to be refreshing and indeed highly effective. I can say with some certainty that he always held the respect of academic and administrative staff as one of the most effective members of Hull’s Admin team. \r\n"

               "description":"This book was written for you - the business leader, sales and marketing professional to help you develop the competencies to set your organization apart, advance your career and feel job satisfaction instead of frustration. We wrote it because in our experience, and from the research we have done, we know that organizations are not good at differentiating in ways that resonate with their customers. And copycat marketing and sales programs are not only ineffective, they leave your customers feeling uninspired, bored and unmotivated to take action.\nWhile lots of books have been written about how to advance your marketing and sales technical skills, not many books focus on what you, as an individual, can do to develop yourself and your team to build long-term success in marketing and sales - no matter what new technology or technique comes on the market.  \n\nThe competencies we’ve uncovered, and share aren’t something that will quickly go out of style or be replaced.",

               "date":"Dec 22, 2016",
               "description":"This book offers both marketing and sales professionals a rare combined insight into both worlds to continuously capture customer intelligence and create value, by blending detailed research with academic rigor and commercial experience of the authors in both Europe and North America. \n\nIt has never been easier to produce great marketing content and sales collateral. And yet, 90% of the content that marketing produces is NEVER used by sales. Why not? Because it’s not relevant to the audience or the prospect doesn’t even know the content exists. Furthermore 58% of deals end up in “no decision” because Sales has not presented value effectively.\n\nCompanies are creating lots of noise but failing to resonate with the customers.\n\nSo what? The danger, aside from marketing wasting tens of millions of dollars on ineffective content and tools, is that customers will disengage. 94% of prospects say they have completely disengaged with vendors because of irrelevant content.\n\nIn order to grow fast, the authors argue, Sales and Marketing teams need to slow down. They need to work together to truly understand their customers’ needs, wants, motivations and pain points so that they can offer customized “value”.  The book sets out how to establish a formal program to continuously capture customer intelligence and insights – the shiny gems of understanding that help prospects to connect the dots – so that value can be consistently articulated in marketing and sales conversations.\n\nBy integrating the best ideas and practice from commercial experience and academic research the authors show how to create value across the entire marketing and sales value chain – not only get a new customer, but to continue to create value for future purchases by creating “post-sales” value.\n",

               "description":"ABSTRACT\nThe quest for substance, capability, and strategic autonomy goes on – or does it? Is the objective of CSDP territorial defence and strategic autonomy, or crisis management and softer security concerns like peacekeeping, border management, protection of shipping lanes, and/or cyber security? The Union needs to move beyond familiar complaints about the lack of common strategic culture and EU intrusion into NATO responsibilities. Geostrategic and economic imperatives dictate that the EU should progress CSDP beyond civilian crisis management in the EU Neighbourhood, and military training and security sector reform (SSR). The Strategic Compass must signal CSDP clarity of objectives, coherence, enhanced capability, and appropriate burden sharing with NATO. The response to the Strategic Compass must build European strategic autonomy in ways that strengthen NATO. For military strategic and economic reasons, both the EU and the post-Brexit UK need intensive cooperation to maintain their geostrategic relevance and strengthen the NATO alliance. This paper reflects on prospects for the EU Strategic Compass and offers timely analysis of recent trends in EU foreign and security policy and expresses cautious optimism regarding the enhanced European strategic autonomy/actorness.",

Callaghan uses cluster analysis to group countries based on key drug-related outcomes and policies, and finds that countries with similar policies have a range of outcomes, and do not fit any particular typologies. However, investigating these relationships further she finds that national drug strategies, at times, are seen to relate to prioritised drug-related outcomes, suggesting the potential positive effects of policy. Callaghan concludes by arguing that the socio-economic context of countries should not be underestimated given the highly varied drug-related outcomes of countries with similar policy regimes. ",

Special areas of interest include: the support needs of people living with a chronic illness or disability; the prevention of work-related stress and burnout; and involving people traditionally considered 'hard to reach' in projects.   I am also an experienced facilitator of meetings, workshops and training events, often with the aim of supporting organisations to make evidence-based changes to practice.   Whilst self-motivated and confident in working independently to deliver complex and challenging projects to strict deadlines, I also enjoy being part of a team, working with and encouraging others to bring about project completion.

The thesis is very well-written and well-structured. It focuses on important and less developed aspects of qualitative research on policing\"\n\n\"Kammersgaard has in an impressive way throughout the dissertation presented empirical analyses intertwined with the use of sophisticated theories. His point of departure is a Foucauldian analytical framework, drawing especially on governmentality literature, but integrating these perspectives with other relevant conceptual frameworks such as procedural justice, soft power and harm reduction policing. It is unusual to find the combination of empirical rigour and theoretical sophistication that Kammersgaard demonstrates in this thesis and it is a combination that serves him well.”\n"

Caroline has generously given her time and energy to work on a range of social marketing courses at Durham Business School on our MSc Strategic Marketing, MBA and GLC programmes.  This has involved: time given in the preparation of courses, through sound bites and application of theory but also in planning sessions to be run live with the students.  Her lively and engaging outlook means the students have, and will continue to gain a fantastic understanding of what is to really work in social marketing."

Michael worked extremely well with the company to overcome a number of constraints on the project which were unexpected at the beginning of the project.  His creativity in overcoming these problems and issues showed fantastic resourcefulness and showed him to be an innovative thinker.   \r\n\r\nHe was thorough in his work and preparation for each meeting and stage of the project.  He always worked in a professional and conscientious manner.  \r\n\r\nHe has been one of the best MBA students I have supervised to date both in terms of his hardworking nature and his creativity.\r\n\r\nHe has an obvious enthusiasm for the subject area, and great knowledge of it and I see no reason why he would not fit into any organisation in which he wanted to work."

This is an innovative research project that studies electric mobility in the five Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) with a special focus on Vehicle to Grid (V2G) technology. The project started in 2015.\n\nRelying on a mix of concepts and methods, our project explores the business and social benefits, barriers, and policies involved in a Nordic transition to V2G. Central to the project is the fieldwork, interviews, and surveys we have planned in each country with various stakeholders. The goal is to use the resulting data to compare and contrast the five countries (and the Nordics internationally) on the best practices that help achieve the shift to electric mobility and a further development of V2G.
